# BENTO CHALLENGE

## Overview

This project was created as part of a challenge for a company called Bento, aiming to showcase my skills and approach to working with their team.

### Decision-Making Process

Throughout this project, several critical decisions had to be made regarding the direction to take, how to begin, which state management solution to use, and more.

I decided to start by creating custom files that would be utilized throughout the project, such as `colors.dart`, `text.dart`, and `spacing.dart`. The goal was to centralize specific elements in a single file to facilitate easy reuse across the project. For instance, in the `colors.dart` file, I included colors that were frequently used for button backgrounds, text, etc. This centralization ensures that if there’s a need to update colors, text sizes, or other styles, they can be adjusted in one place.

After setting up these foundational files, I moved on to the actual project, beginning with the app bar, followed by the bottom navigation bar, and wrapping up with the two main screens: the Home Page and the Product Details Page. I intended to do more, but due to a tight schedule and unexpected challenges at work during the week, I couldn’t expand further.

Once the app bar, bottom navigation bar, and the two screens were complete, I implemented Provider for state management. I chose Provider because it’s recommended by the Flutter team, is straightforward to configure, and offers highly efficient performance.
